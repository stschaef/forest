\taxon{Definition}

\p{A \em{semantic category} is a [closed category](sss-0005) #{S} such that there is a semantic functor #{F : C \to S} that preserves the closed structure.}

\p{This notion is underwhelming, as it does not much insight into semantics nor does this paper give satisfying examples of semantics.}
