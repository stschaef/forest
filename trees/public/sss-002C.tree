\title{Am I on to Something?}

\p{
Here I am documenting the half-baked ideas I've had but have never taken anywhere. On these I've either been out of depth on the requisite knowledge, rediscovered something that isn't as new as I'd hoped, or simply don't have the time. I hope one day I can return to these an flesh them out.
