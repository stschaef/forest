We propose an alternative constructive approach that does not prescribe, a priori, a specific quantifier prefix.

While various attempts have been made to exploit symmetry in verification applications, to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a direct link between symmetry and quantification in the context of clause learning during incremental induction.
