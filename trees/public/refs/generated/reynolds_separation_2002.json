The simple imperative programming language is extended with commands (not expressions) for accessing and modifying shared structures, and for explicit allocation and deallocation of storage. Assertions are extended by introducing a \"separating conjunction\" that asserts that its subformulas hold for disjoint parts of the heap, and a closely related \"separating implication\". Coupled with the inductive definition of predicates on abstract data structures, this extension permits the concise and flexible description of structures with controlled sharing. In this paper, we survey the current development of this program logic, including extensions that permit unrestricted address arithmetic, dynamically allocated arrays, and recursive procedures. We also discuss promising future directions.", "accessed": {"date-parts": [[2024, 11, 14]]}, "author": [{"family": "Reynolds", "given": "J.
