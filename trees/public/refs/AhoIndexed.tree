 abstract = {A new type of grammar for generating formal languages, called an indexed grammar, is presented. An indexed grammar is an extension of a context-free grammar, and the class of languages generated by indexed grammars has closure properties and decidability results similar to those for context-free languages. The class of languages generated by indexed grammars properly includes all context-free languages and is a proper subset of the class of context-sensitive languages. Several subclasses of indexed grammars generate interesting classes of languages.},
